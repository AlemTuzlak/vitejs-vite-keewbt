## Status

Accepted

## Context

Commit messages should be easily identifiable, straight to the point and
explain why changes have been made instead of what has been changed.

In order to achieve this we should write commit messages according to the
following rules:

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
8. Add references to the issue tracker at the bottom of your commit message
9. Add references to Sentry issues if there are any below the issue tracker references

### Example of a good commit message

```
Summarize changes in around 50 characters or less

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72
characters or so. In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of the commit and the rest of the text as the body. The
blank line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless
you omit the body entirely); various tools like `log`, `shortlog`
and `rebase` can get confused if you run the two together.

Explain the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why you
are making this change as opposed to how (the code explains that).
Are there side effects or other unintuitive consequences of this
change? Here's the place to explain them.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

 - Bullet points are okay, too

 - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded
   by a single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions
   vary here

Please put references to the issue tracker at the bottom,
like this:

Resolves: #123
See also: #456, #789

Please put references to sentry issues below this,
like so:

Fixes SENTRY-317
```

## Decision

Follow the proposed 7 rules for commit messages

## Consequences

New commit messages should be more standardised and clear to read.
However, this might introduce more time writing commit messages.
