title: Test group naming
---

## Status

- Accepted

## Problem

To ensure all tests adhere to the same type of group name convention, we should all agree on what types of
test groups we have and why they belong there.

These groups should be added to all tests by using a `@group` phpdoc block above the class of the test.

## Solution

This list of test naming should cover all types of test cases
- *Acceptance*:
    - Written by a product owner or business people and test end-to-end.
    - It boots up the application.
- *End-to-end*:
    - Tests from the UI onto the persistence mechanism.
    - 3rd party code
    - The UI might be a graphical UI used by humans, or an API, used by 3rd party systems.
    - It boots up the application.
- *Functional*:
    - Tests a set of business logic. Ie a use case (Command/handler), or a service method.
    - It boots up the application, either to dispatch a command, an event, or to get a
      service to execute one of its methods.
- *Integration*:
    - Tests the integration of our application with external systems, where an external system can be:
        - a database
        - a 3rd party API
        - a cross cutting library
        - a delivery mechanism, ie:
    - HTTP: Test that when an HTTP request reaches the application, it dispatches a specific command.
        - The result of the command being dispatched should be tested with a functional test though.
    - CLI:  Test that when an CLI command is run, it dispatches a specific command.
        - The result of the command being dispatched should be tested with a functional test though.
   - It boots up the application.
- *Micro*:
    - Tests a small group of methods or classes, without needing to boot up the application.
    - It does NOT boot up the application.

## Technical value
Having a clear definition will help us:
 - Not discuss it further in MRs
 - Create tests groups, which will allow us to run only specific groups at specific times to reduce the time a test suite takes to run.
