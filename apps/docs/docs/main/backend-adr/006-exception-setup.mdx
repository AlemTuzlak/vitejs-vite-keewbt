title: Exception setup
---

## Status

Accepted

## Context

To ease differentiating between categories of exceptions that occur within our application we
create our own base exceptions that we extend from. These Exceptions fall into 2 categories.

- **Logic exceptions** point to bugs in our code and should almost never occur, instead they should be caught
by our tooling (tests, phpstan) before reaching production.
  - **BadMethodCallException**
  - **InvalidArgumentException**

- **Runtime exceptions** These point to things that can only occur during runtime. Due to their nature, these will be the majority of our
  exceptions.
  - **Input exceptions**, are based on the input of the user, these can usually be solved by the user by fixing their input.
  - **System Exceptions**, these are things the user has no impact on and will have to try again at a later time.
    Examples hereof are 3rd party API outages, misconfigurations, or expired credentials.

## Decision

Our code should not depend on the default php exceptions, but intead throw our own custom implementations of these.
This allows our code to always rely on these default types and based on their type return different errors to the user.
