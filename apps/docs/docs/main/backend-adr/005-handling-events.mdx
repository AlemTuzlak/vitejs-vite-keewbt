title: 005 - Handling events
---

## Status

Accepted

## Context

In any system, there are multiple types of events that are handled on different levels.
The current event types we see in our application are

### Domain events
These events are dispatched only by our core application in the application or domain layer.
They signify important moments in our domain and are used to communicate between different components.

Events of this type can be listened to from anywhere within our system eg.
- Other components to react to changes made elsewhere
- The same component to other type of work
- Infrastructure, to sync data to 3rd parties

### Framework events
These events are dispatched only by the framework in use and should never enter our application.

Events of this type can only be listened to in the infrastructure layer.

The purpose of these events is to allow us to deal with specific framework events like these examples from Symfony
- kernel.request
- kernel.controller
- kernel.controller_arguments
- kernel.view

### External Events
These events are dispatched by our presentation layer as a response to either webhooks or CLI commands that poll external systems.
They signify changes made by other systems that we might be interested in.

These events may also pass along the original payload to it's handler so it can handle it further.
We avoid parsing this payload into a DTO at this point to avoid coupling our code to external input.
This because, we do not own this input ourselve and the third party might decide to change it at any point breaking our
implementation immediately. By having the payload as part of the queueable event, we can leverage the Queue to ensure
that if the payload changes, the message would get stuck in the queue and we can fix the issue and retry them later.

Events of this type can only be listened to in the infrastructure layer eg.
- Paypal webhook about disputes of which the payload is normalised in a paypal specific listener
- Adyen webhook about disputes of which the paypal is normalised in a adyen specific listener

The purpose of these events is to ensure our webhooks can respond to the external parties very quickly, as is often best practise.
And divert the normalisation process to a listener for that purpose. This listener then in turn will dispatch any commands
when our application needs to handle the event further.

## Decision

- Any event must be serialisable.
- All events will go through the same event bus.
- All events will implement an interface of the type that they belong to.
