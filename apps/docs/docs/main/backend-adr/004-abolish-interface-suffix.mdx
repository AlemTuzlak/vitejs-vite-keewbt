title: Abolish Interface suffix

## Status

Approved

## Context

The `Interface` suffix can be seen as redundant as our code wants an implementation to work with and not an interface.
For that matter, `Interface` is just a tool to ensure we follow a certain "contract" when creating an implementation.
Which implementation our code ends up using, doesn't matter as much.

As such, we stop using the `Interface` suffix in order to ensure our implementations are named with what they do rather than
naming interfaces with the suffix to differentiate them.

We cannot change external code, and since we do allow the usage of PSR interfaces, we will not enforce our naming schema on them.

### Example
```php
interface HttpClient
{
    public function get(string $url): Psr\ResponseInterface;
}

final class SymfonyHttpClient implements HttpClient
{
    public function get(string $url): Psr\ResponseInterface
    {
        // ... Implementation
    }
}

final class ApiClient
{
    public function __construct(
        private HttpClient $httpClient // This gets injected the SymfonyHttpClient
    ) {
    }
}
```

As you can see here, the Api client looks a lot cleaner by just having the `HttpClient` rather than a `HttpClientInterface`,
it also does not 'care' that it's talking to an `Interface`.


## Decision

Abolish the usage of the `Interface` suffix entirely for our own codebase.
Accepted external sources like `Psr` can still have the `Interface` suffix.
