## Documentation architecture

The main documentation is located under the `docs` folder under the root of the project.

Under the main folder you will find a `versions.json` file used to create the versioning dropdown in the header (invisible if no more than one)

You can create new folders under the `docs` folder to create new versions of the documentation.

If you decide to do this you should copy over the latest version of the documentation to the new folder and start editing from there.

### versions.json

This file is located under the root of the `docs` folder and is used to create the versioning dropdown in the header.
In order to add a new version you should add a new object to the array with the following structure:

```json
{
	"version": "1.0.0",
	"tag": "main"
}
```

### Version folder structure

The structure of the documentation is as follows:

```
docs
├── version-folder
│   ├── group1
│   │   ├── index.md
│   │   ├── writing-docs.mdx
│   ├── group2
│   │   ├── index.md
│   │   ├── quick-start.mdx
│   ├── metadata.json
```

The main folder contains all your documentation and you can use folders to group your documentation into categories.
Each version folder (in this case main) contains a `metadata.json` file that is used to create the sidebar navigation.

The `metadata.json` file should have the following structure:

```json
{
	"paths": {
		"slug": "path/to/file",
		// eg:
		"quick-start": "started/quick-start"
	},
	"sections": [
		// Used to group docs into sections
		"Backend",
		"Frontend"
	],
	"meta": {
		"slug": {
			"title": "Shown in the left sidebar",
			"section": "The section where the doc is placed (has to match the sections part above)",
			"slug": "matches the slug from the paths which tells it where to find the file"
		}

	},
	// if it has index.mdx file
	"hasIndex": true
}
```

Folders represent logical groups where you can put related documentation files. Each folder can contain as many files as you want.
The names of the files are up to you, the only thing that matters is that the `slug` value in the `metadata.json` matches the file to the path,
eg if you have a file under `group1` folder called `quick-start.mdx` and you want to access it under the `quick-start` path you should set the
`slug` value to `group1/quick-start`.

```json
{
	"paths": {
		// slug in url  | path to file
		"quick-start": "group1/quick-start"
	}
}
```

After that you can add a new entry in the `meta` object with the following structure:

```json
{
	// Matches our "paths" slug
	"quick-start": {
		"title": "Title of your section",
		"section": "Description",
		"slug": "quick-start"
	}
}
```

## Writing your first file

### Heading & frontmatter
When you create a new file you should add the following frontmatter:

```md
---
title: "Your title (rendered at the top of the document)"
description: "Description (rendered under the title)"
hidden: false // If you want to hide the document from the sidebar
toc: true // Table of contents on the right
---
// Add an empty new line after this here
...
```
This instructs the documentation system how to render the title and the description and also if the TOC on the right
should be rendered. If you want to hide the document from the sidebar you should set the `hidden` value to `true`.

### Writing content

You can write your content in markdown or MDX. If you want to use MDX you should use the `.mdx` extension. We recommend
using MDX regardless of the content as it allows you to use React components in your documentation.

The following section on components will show you how to use them in your documentation.

After you have written your content you should add the file to the `metadata.json` file in the version folder.
